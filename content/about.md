The consortium’s mission is to support software development communities to build free and open source publishing infrastructures.

The consortium is led by: Open Science principles, the recognition of the lack of quality and innovation in technical publishing systems, and in academic publishing a sector held back by monopolistic restrictions.

The consortium is a research network led by the TIB – German National Library of Science and Technology and is made up of research organisations, businesses, researchers, and community groups.

The consortium’s activities include; research and research publishing, software development, business development, advocacy, publishing, events and peer-learning.

The consortium is open to all areas of publishing. The current priority (2019) is interoperability between software platforms in scholarly publishing that are using multi-format and multimedia functionality.

### Connecting Platforms

The consortium supports an infrastructural backend microservices software ecology called ADA to connect publishing platforms to enable — continuous validation, automatic deployment, real-time processing, multi-format outputs, and multimedia features.

The objective is to promote design excellence in — authoring systems, publication layout and interface design, librarianship and engineering — to enable diverse and global communities in the pursuit of knowledge creation and dissemination.

Key to the infrastructural approach is a notion of a universal fluid document model based on format transformation aligned to output requirements, rather than fixed format standards. The fluid document model is then combined with a test-driven methodology combining continuous validation and technologies including real-time processing, cryptographic IDs, flat-file storage, Docker virtualisation, encrypted documents and content distribution network APIs.

The goal of the infrastructure is to create a new synthesis of computational automation and human skills and agency, adding next-gen reliability and speed to publication production. In turn this new synthesis will change the use and control of knowledge institutions and industries.
